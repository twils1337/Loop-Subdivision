# Loop Subdivision and Smoothing
In this project, I implemented the Loop Subdivision algorithm with smoothing.
This project was done for my CS130: Computer Graphics class. This project was built 
on CentOS, but should work on any Unix/Linux OS given that the GLUT is installed and that the
program has all the correct paths to OpenGL/GLUT. It was later expanded to incorporate [ray tracing and
phong shading](https://github.com/twils1337/PhongShading).
